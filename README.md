# To-do

A to-do list for myself. Feel free to create PRs with stuff for me to do at some point, I guess.

Will probably only be updated semi-regularly.

## Projects

- Bring the [Ayase platform](https://github.com/r3c0d3x/ayase/blob/master/README.md) to a usable state
- Make a service to automatically archive all tweets from verified (at some point in time) accounts
  - Perhaps we can work with [TweetSave](https://tweetsave.com/) on this?
- Make an OSS archive.is clone. As in, we make something that people can use to run their own archive.is clone.

## Misc.

- Take over the world (low priority)
